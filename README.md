# ImageQualityEnhancer

A workflow designed to improve image quality by providing a user interface to upload an image, extracting relevant features, using an AI model to suggest edits, applying the edits, presenting a comparison of original and enhanced images, and allowing additional manual adjustments.
## Initial generation prompt
A workflow named ImageQualityEnhancer that performs the following steps: 1. First, a component that provides a user interface to upload an image file. 2. Then, a component that processes the uploaded image and extracts relevant features, such as brightness, contrast, color balance, and sharpness. 3. Next, a component that uses an AI model (e.g., a pre-trained image enhancement neural network) to analyze the extracted features and suggest edits that can improve the image's quality. 4. After that, a component that applies the suggested edits to the image and generates a preview of the enhanced image. 5. A component that presents the user with a side-by-side comparison of the original and enhanced images, along with the specific edits that were applied. 6. Finally, a component that allows the user to download the enhanced image or make additional manual adjustments to fine-tune the results.
