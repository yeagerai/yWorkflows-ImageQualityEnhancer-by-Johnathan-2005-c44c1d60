# Component Name
ImageQualityEnhancer

## Description
The ImageQualityEnhancer component is a building block within a Yeager Workflow designed to compare an original image with an enhanced version of the same image, and return the details of the comparison as well as the enhanced image.

## Input and Output Models
The component has the following input and output data models:
- Input: `ImageUpload`
  - image: `UploadFile` type; The image to be compared and enhanced.
- Output: Tuple of `ImageComparison` and `EnhancedImage`
  - `ImageComparison`
    - original_image: bytes; The original image data.
    - enhanced_image: bytes; The enhanced image data.
    - edits: List[str]; A list of strings detailing the edits made during the enhancement process.
  - `EnhancedImage`
    - enhanced_image: bytes; The enhanced image data.

## Parameters
The component has the following parameters:
- args: `ImageUpload`; Required. The input image to be compared and enhanced.
- callbacks: `typing.Any`; Optional. Additional callback functions provided within a Yeager Workflow context. Default is `None`.

## Transform Function
The `transform` function of the ImageQualityEnhancer consists of these steps:
1. Call the parent class `AbstractWorkflow`'s `transform` method with the provided args and optional callbacks. Receive a `results_dict` containing the original image, enhanced image, and an array of edits as dictionary keys.
2. Extract the `original_image`, `enhanced_image`, and `edits` from the `results_dict`.
3. Create an instance of `ImageComparison` using the extracted data, then create an instance of `EnhancedImage` with the `enhanced_image` bytes.
4. Return a tuple with `ImageComparison` and `EnhancedImage` instances as the result of the transformation process.

## External Dependencies
- `fastapi`: A web framework used for exposing the component as an API.
- `typing`: A library used for defining more complex type hints.
- `pydantic`: A library used for data validation and serialization using Python data classes.

## API Calls
There are no external API calls involved in this component.

## Error Handling
The component inherits error handling capabilities from the parent class `AbstractWorkflow`, which includes handling errors during the transformation process and any application-specific exceptions.

## Examples

Below is an example of using the ImageQualityEnhancer within a Yeager Workflow:
